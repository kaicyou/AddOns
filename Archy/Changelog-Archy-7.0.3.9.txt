--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Add configuration option and supporting code for enabling/disabling the default UI's dig site progress bar. Addresses ticket #550.
	- Always show solvable artifacts, even if the list is filtered to the current continent. Fixes ticket #489.
	- Minor cleanup.
	- Use HereBeDragons to set the CurrentContinentID instead of GetCurrentMapContinent, which now returns the highest ID immediately after login. Fixes ticket #599.
	- Change dig site blacklist to use a dig site's blobID instead of its name, since it's entirely possible to have two dig sites with the same name. Existing dig site blacklists will be invalidated, since there's no way to properly map between the two.
	- Improve layout for Artifacts and Dig Sites config panels.
	- Prevent RaceID.Unknown from being listed in the autofill options.
	- Prevent RaceID.Unknown from being listed in the blacklist options.
