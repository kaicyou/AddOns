*3.07.31 (09-JUL-2017)*
 * removed - config options for in-combat yielding
 * added - config options for thread timeout values (defaults to 100ms for in-combat and 100ms for out-of-combat)
 * changed - bag, pet, mount, toybox, heirloom, mailbox, auction, void storage, and vault scans are now threaded
 * changed - window drawing is now threaded all the time (not just in combat) - initial window draw can be a bit laggy
 * changed - restack should be a bit slower but leave the game more responsive (depends on what you set the out of combat thread timeout to)
 * fixed - issue where pet scanning might sometimes not run
 * fixed - bag rescans will now just rescan the bag having an issue, not all the bags in that location
 * fixed - issue with search filter initilisation causing a second window rebuild at the first open
 * fixed - issue with font size on initial window load
