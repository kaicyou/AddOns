Due to the concern of increasing addon file size, we have moved out 
part of our dungeon maps and built-in plug-ins into separated addon package.

Users who download our addons from some of the famous game web sites 
may only get our core addon which only include the Atlas core function 
and the latest WoW expansion maps.

If you also want to see all the old expansions' maps, and also want all those 
Atlas plug-ins made by us, you have to download and install them separately.

Read below forum topic for more information:
