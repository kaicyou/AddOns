    much energy before the GCD ends.

    Alpha Commit 1
    
    Addon
    A new Use More CPU toggle is added in case you hate having extra frames.
    Separated Ability options into its own tab.
    You can tell the addon to pretend an ability is on cooldown if/when it
    is toggled off.  This works better for some SimulationCraft APLs (i.e.,
    Retribution’s default APL would otherwise hold Holy Power forever
    waiting to hit Crusade).
    Trinkets tab renamed Trinkets/Gear because there are rings, too.
    
    All Classes:
    Expanded Use Items, added more trinkets (and a ring), updated its
    (hidden) APL.
    Arcane Torrent is now flagged as an interrupt, not a DPS CD.
    Support for pool_resource started.  This is used by Feral Druids if Use
    More CPU is checked.
    New Legendaries added, including their buffs/procs.
    If you have an entry for Use Items in your APL, it will not try to use
    any items that were used *previously* in your action list.  So “Use
    Items” is the fallback if your class/spec doesn’t have its own logic.
    If Use Items is placed first, then the settings from the Trinkets/Gear
    tab will be used.
    
    Death Knight:
    Updated Frost and Unholy APLs.
    Gave the addon some extra insight into when to re-test abilities, to
    help avoid entries popping forward in the queue.
    Added missing Master of Ghouls and Unholy Frenzy auras.
    Added T21 gear set.
    
    Demon Hunter:
    Added T21 gear set.
    Taught the addon when to recheck some abilities.
    Updated Havoc APLs.
    Vengeance will need further attention/revision in the near future.
    
    Druid:
    Fix for Ashamane’s Energy.
    Support T20 2pc energy gains from Rip ticks (from current target only).
    Add missing Jungle Stalker, Moonfire Cat, Scent of Blood auras.
    T20 4pc will extend Rip’s base duration.
    Add T21, Apex Predator buff (4pc).
    Update/revise/fix the persistent multiplier for dot snapshots.
    Adjust Brutal Slash’s ready time based on how many charges you specified
    for single-target.
    Ferocious Bite is usable w/ 0 combo points if Apex Predator is up.
    Moonfire Cat is the same as Moonfire in the ability DB.
    Prowl is treated as unusable outside of boss fights (I should also check
    if you’re in a dungeon) to avoid dropping combat in the world.
    Removed the old ready timer for Rake since the recheck system will
    handle it.
    Swipe Cat/Bear/Swipe are the same ability.
    Thrash Cat/Thrash Bear/Thrash are the same ability.
    Updated the Feral APLs.
    
    Hunter:
    Changed from old known() system to talent/notalent for many abilities.
    Implemented rechecks for important dots/buffs/debuffs.
    Updated SimC APLs, twice.
    
    Paladin:
    Updated Ret APLs.
    Implemented Ret T21.
    Added many items to the Ret APL.
    TODO:  Add in Rechecks.
    
    Shaman:
    Updated APLs.
    Implemented T21 for both specs.
    TODO:  Add in Rechecks.
    TODO:  Support Gnawed Thumb Ring.
    
    Warrior:
    Initial build of Warrior abilities, both Fury and Arms.  Still a hot
    mess.
    
    Engine/Core:
    Removed a lot of commented out, deprecated code.
    Implemented recheck system in predictive engine.
    Implemented pool_resource in iterative engine.
    Iterative engine looks for a better ability when you’d otherwise be
    waiting for something.  Requires “Use More CPU” to be checked.
    Revised the APL stack system.
    When the predictive engine checks for abilities after a “Run Action
    List” has occurred, the following entries will check to be sure we
    weren’t supposed to give up in RAL.
    I can type /run Hekili:Test() when Use More CPU is enabled and it will
    tell me when it scrapes up a better recommendation (very rare if a spec
    supports rechecks).
    Displays will now update when paused, but new recommendations won’t be
    generated.
    The event system will force addon updates a lot more frequently.  Will
    continue to tune this.
    
    Options:
    Added UI support for setting up Pool Resources.
    Will feign cooldown when abilities are disabled for many default CDs.
    Class Settings became Class/Specialization.
    Abilities can be modified a bit via their own options tab.
    Removed “display” component to hidden SimulationCraft importer.
    
    Scripts:
    Made adjustments to the timeToReady function when pooling.
    
    Targets:
    The target system will trust your judgment more when considering how to
    count targets.

    Elemental updates.
    
    Removed "aggressive stormkeeper option."  Replaced with "save for aoe"
    toggle that applies to both SK and LMT.
    Fixed the addon to actually spend Maelstrom as an Elemental Shaman.
    Aftershock revised to reduce MP costs by 30% rather than refund the
    costs (saves CPU, helps w/ Maelstrom spending issue).

    APL updates.
    
    Death Knight: Unholy and Frost updated.
    
    Demon Hunter: Havoc APLs imported.  Option for Fel Rush adjusted to
    simply turn-off the ability if you don't want the addon to mess with it
    (obviously has negative affects for some talent builds).
    
    Druid:  Feral APL imported, messed w/ it a bit.  Still not fully
    functional.
    Druids will also see the delay timers on the upper left.
    The keybind scraper will be more aggressive for druids because of forms
    and it annoys me.
    
    Monk: Windwalker APL updated, "strict check" toggle applied to APL
    checks but this still will need more work.
    The auto-APL for using trinkets will be adjusted to *not* use Vial or
    Moonglaives because those have their own entries in the Windwalker APLs.

    Retribution
    
    Fix for "TV spam" when people disable the Wake of Ashes / Artifact
    Ability recommendation.  The APL recommends spending TV even w/o
    Judgment up if Wake of Ashes is off CD or coming off CD soon.  The APL
    will now only make this recommendation if you're allowing the addon to
    recommend WoA.

    Efficiency fixes...
    
    Clean up usable item detection a bit more, still need to fix a bug with
    cooldown detection on first load...
    
    Frost DK:  Tweak hungering_rune_weapon based on recent changes.  APL
    updates to follow.
    
    Paladin:  APL updates for Protection; correct Soul ring Talents.
    
    Shaman:  APL updates.
    
    Warrior:  Not supported, don't look here!
    
    Core:  First round of efficiency tweaks; far fewer retests when
    double-checking predictive recommendations.  Also, resource modeling and
    forecasting is more efficient.
    
    Events:  Will only update recommendations for 1 display per frame at
    maximum.  Cycles so that one particular display isn't repeatedly updated
    while others are ignored.
    
    Importer:  Will automatically replace debuff.judgment.up with
    judgment_override on imports to allow usage of the Retribution class
    option.
    
    Scripts:  Adding flagging for time-sensitive scripts.  Will use this
    later to avoid retesting criteria that isn't time-sensitive (i.e.,
    talent.X.enabled) vs. stuff that is time-sensitive (buff.X.up).
    
    More on Resource Modeling:  The addon will now update resource forecasts
    when resources are spent or gained, and only update the resources that
    were changed (via spendResources(), spend(), or gain()).  This is a lot
    more efficient than remodeling resources every time the engine steps
    forward in time (which happens multiple times per icon displayed).

    Trinket Support
    
    Shaman:  Added APL tweaks and class setting to allow Doom Winds to
    desynchronize from Ascendance when cooldowns are turned off.
    
    Added baseline support for a number of trinkets.
    
    They are accessible via the "Usable Items" action (which will try each
    support trinket, with settings available through /hekili).  They can
    also be added manually to action lists (i.e., "Kil'jaeden's Burning
    Wish" is a supported action).

    Lots of stuff.
    
    DeathKnight:  Add Blighted Rune Weapon.
    Monk:  Add Pressure Point from WW T20.
    Shaman:  Add setting for saving Crash Lightning stacks (will want to
    adjust this on a per-fight basis).
    Add 'Strike' as an alias for 'Stormstrike' for simc compatibility.
    Warrior:  Commit contributed Warrior updates.
    Core:  Commit hybrid prediction system; tries to find a recommendation
    for now.  If there's no recommendation right now, uses the iterative
    system to take steps forward in time to see if that changes.  If that
    finds nothing, uses the recommendation it came up with for later.
    Hekili:  Load library or other addon stubs as needed instead of keeping
    them in a library table.
    Scripts:  Fix infinite loop when cleaning up =/== assignment/comparison
    operators.
    Ready scripts round up to 2 decimals again...
    State:  Abilities that are disabled by a toggle or otherwise not known
    will no longer have a false cooldown of 1 hour.  Need to decide what to
    do for synchronized abilities (i.e., Doom Winds will be held until
    Ascendance is up, just following default SimC APL).
    Stop losing track of memory by wiping the forecast table, we just ignore
    extra tables at this point.
