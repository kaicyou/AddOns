    Efficiency fixes...
    
    Clean up usable item detection a bit more, still need to fix a bug with
    cooldown detection on first load...
    
    Frost DK:  Tweak hungering_rune_weapon based on recent changes.  APL
    updates to follow.
    
    Paladin:  APL updates for Protection; correct Soul ring Talents.
    
    Shaman:  APL updates.
    
    Warrior:  Not supported, don't look here!
    
    Core:  First round of efficiency tweaks; far fewer retests when
    double-checking predictive recommendations.  Also, resource modeling and
    forecasting is more efficient.
    
    Events:  Will only update recommendations for 1 display per frame at
    maximum.  Cycles so that one particular display isn't repeatedly updated
    while others are ignored.
    
    Importer:  Will automatically replace debuff.judgment.up with
    judgment_override on imports to allow usage of the Retribution class
    option.
    
    Scripts:  Adding flagging for time-sensitive scripts.  Will use this
    later to avoid retesting criteria that isn't time-sensitive (i.e.,
    talent.X.enabled) vs. stuff that is time-sensitive (buff.X.up).
    
    More on Resource Modeling:  The addon will now update resource forecasts
    when resources are spent or gained, and only update the resources that
    were changed (via spendResources(), spend(), or gain()).  This is a lot
    more efficient than remodeling resources every time the engine steps
    forward in time (which happens multiple times per icon displayed).

    Trinket Support
    
    Shaman:  Added APL tweaks and class setting to allow Doom Winds to
    desynchronize from Ascendance when cooldowns are turned off.
    
    Added baseline support for a number of trinkets.
    
    They are accessible via the "Usable Items" action (which will try each
    support trinket, with settings available through /hekili).  They can
    also be added manually to action lists (i.e., "Kil'jaeden's Burning
    Wish" is a supported action).

    Lots of stuff.
    
    DeathKnight:  Add Blighted Rune Weapon.
    Monk:  Add Pressure Point from WW T20.
    Shaman:  Add setting for saving Crash Lightning stacks (will want to
    adjust this on a per-fight basis).
    Add 'Strike' as an alias for 'Stormstrike' for simc compatibility.
    Warrior:  Commit contributed Warrior updates.
    Core:  Commit hybrid prediction system; tries to find a recommendation
    for now.  If there's no recommendation right now, uses the iterative
    system to take steps forward in time to see if that changes.  If that
    finds nothing, uses the recommendation it came up with for later.
    Hekili:  Load library or other addon stubs as needed instead of keeping
    them in a library table.
    Scripts:  Fix infinite loop when cleaning up =/== assignment/comparison
    operators.
    Ready scripts round up to 2 decimals again...
    State:  Abilities that are disabled by a toggle or otherwise not known
    will no longer have a false cooldown of 1 hour.  Need to decide what to
    do for synchronized abilities (i.e., Doom Winds will be held until
    Ascendance is up, just following default SimC APL).
    Stop losing track of memory by wiping the forecast table, we just ignore
    extra tables at this point.

    Fixes.
    
    - prevent infinite loop in modelResources()
    - workaround for Windstrike CD (it can end up about a hundredth of a
    second greater than GCD, leading to two lower priority abilities woven
    in instead of alternating Windstrikes).  Better fix is pending.
    - prevent bug that allowed lower priority abilities to sometimes sneak
    through.  Sneaky abilities.

    7.2.5
    
    Overview
    --------
    Updated for 7.2.5.
    
    Engine is now autotuned, there's no slider for it.
    
    Engine now crawls through slices of time instead of attempting to
    project ready times.  The former method was inconsistent with
    SimulationCraft *AND* could fail due to ability criteria timing (i.e.,
    if the conditions were buff.X.remains < 3, then the timing for that
    ability could be much later).
    
    Classes:
    Added Shadowmeld (mainly for Feral Druid support).
    
    Demon Hunters:
    Testing logic to make Fel Rush reflect the 0.25s GCD like in-game.
    Updated APLs; dumped the SimC APLs and using handwritten APL from Icy
    Veins (Havoc).
    
    Feral Druid:
    Some iteration on the Feral Druid model.  Long way to go.  Don't use it.
    
    Survival Hunters:
    Added logic for spending Bone Apron stacks.
    Updated APLs.
    
    Paladins:
    Updated Retribution APLs.
    
    Shamans:
    Updated APLs, removed old MP generation logic, using new model.
    
    Core:
    Cache known/ready/usable criteria to reduce CPU load in each cycle.
    Addon will give up after 50 iterations through an APL (that's around 1s
    + 10 GCDs).
    Delay text only shows tenths of a second at < 1s remaining.
    
    Events:
    Updates Per Second is 0.25s baseline, w/ auto-updates based on events.
    
    Options:
    Minor tweaks.
    
    State:
    Minor fixes for checking ability cost (action.X.cost) and regenerating
    resources as needed.
    
    Targets:
    Nameplate checks will also check boss1 - boss5 in case a huge boss has a
    nameplate that goes off the screen.
    Preliminary support for storing permanent modifiers on auras (for Feral
    Druids, mainly).

    + New regen model for Liadrin's.
    
    Shaman:
    + New maelstrom regen model for Enhancement.
    
    Core:
    + Fixed texture cache for Windstrike, Stormstrike.
    + Adjusted linear time stepping for new engine.
    + Show delay timers for Death Knights; don't use CD wheel for abilities
    that don't have real CDs (should make Frost DK less silly when Hungering
    Rune Weapon is up).
    
    Scripts:
    + Fix conversion of "!0>1" to "not (0>1)" as "not 0>1" is "false>1"
    which is a mismatch.
    
    State:
    + Use new regen model system (linear, not projecting forward).
    + isReadyNow() uses 'ready' resource vs. 'spend' when appropriate.

    I should split things off more often.
    
    General
    -------
    + Trying out a new time-slice based engine instead of the
    projection-based system.  The projection-based system has required too
    many special accommodations (time scripts, hidden retesting, etc.).  The
    major difference is that the addon will try to see what to recommend
    now, and if it doesn't find something, it will just step forward a bit
    in time and try again.  This is more like SimulationCraft, which tests
    for an action and waits 0.1 seconds if no action is available.  The
    addon takes a first 0.1s step and if it doesn't find anything there, it
    starts looking at every quarter-GCD for a recommendation until it finds
    one or runs out of time trying.  Work in progress.
    
    + The remnants of a new resource modeling system has been added, but
    will likely be removed again soon.  It was build for the projection
    system which is no longer used.
    
    Classes
    -------
    + Qualify some auras as "incapacitates" so that the addon will assume
    you can't use abilities during that time frame.  (And by some, I mean
    only Draught of Souls for now.)
    
    Paladin
    -------
    + Guarantee that Liadrin's grants you the first Holy Power from
    AW/Crusade.
    
    Warlock
    -------
    + Rebuilt Soul Shard model; they don't regenerate in any way that we are
    concerned with.
    
    Scripts
    -------
    + Legend has it that C++ "!0>1" and Lua "not 0 > 1" are not equivalent.
    Fix up auto-conversion to make the addon use "not ( 0 > 1 )" where
    applicable.
    
    State
    -----
    + Lots of resource modeling nonsense still in here.
    + Support 'in_flight' check (if an ability has been cast before the
    addon simulation, but hasn't hit).

    Paladin:  Added latency option for Judgment.
    
    + If checked, the use_latency flag will require Judgment to remain up
    for at least latency x 2 before recommending spenders.
    + Updated APLs to use judgment_override again, which includes the
    use_latency behavior above.

    Many fixes, handle it.
    
    Classes
    + Instead of requiring custom funcions for abilities that require a
    talent (or replace a talent), added talent= and notalent= fields to
    abilities.
    + Added Faulty Countermeasure to usable items.
    + Added some shared legendaries and related auras.
    
    Death Knight:
    + pre-populate gargoyle as a pet.
    + sudden_doom stacks to 2 with artifact trait.
    + clawing_shadows fixed.
    
    Demon Hunter
    + health regen effects will no longer cause the addon to stop updating
    health information.
    + APL tweaks to reduce Fel Rush overusage, added class setting for Keep
    Fel Rush Recharging.
    
    Druid
    + Health gains should affect health.actual (to avoid breaking
    health.current) or use gain().
    
    Hunter
    + Fix for T19 detection (wrong itemID used for 1 of the pieces).
    + Health gains should affect health.actual or use gain().
    
    Monk
    + Added healing_elixir, touch_of_karma per request (ToK is in the
    updated APL).
    + Imported latest WW APL, hope nothing breaks.
    
    Core/Engine
    + Start looking up to 60 seconds out, to be more friendly to
    Brewmaster's defensive icon.
    
    Formatting/UI/Debug
    + Show 'nil' value for variables/conditions that are nil, when looking
    at tooltips, etc.
    
    Options
    + Don't let people disable the Global Cooldown using Class Settings /
    Exclusions.
    + Imported APLs will now be spaced out for readability's sake.
    + Added Issue Reporting tab to simplify complaining about my shoddy
    coding.
    + Special modifiers that tend to be string values (i.e., action list
    names) will return string values consistently.
    
    State
    + Possible improvement in time-to-die calculations, though I think I
    still want to rewrite this.
    + Non-boss enemy time-to-die now starts at 15 seconds instead of 300
    seconds.
    
    Utils
    + Imported APL names will get cleaned up a little more
    consistently/accurately using "frontier match" logic.

    Very alpha.  Much warning.
    
    + Preliminary support for on-use items (Draught of Souls, KJBW) -- but
    need to update the importer to convert use_item,name=X to just
    draught_of_souls or kiljaedens_burning_wish.
    + PTR changes for Enhancement Shaman for testing purposes.
    + Affliction Warlock uses prolonged_power pot.
    + Low Impact Mode is now default, uncheck for stronger predictions
    further out, but uses more CPU.

    Testing Warlock stuff (thanks UnleashedD3!)
    
    + Warlock (Affliction) module started by UnleashedD3.
    + Added a feature to tell the addon to break a cast/channel -- the addon
    won't assume you're planning to complete every 6 second channel and will
    instead show you what to do at the next GCD.
    + The feature above is specifically for Drain Soul -- addon will show
    you what to do at next GCD.  Will iterate on this.
    o Also, working on keybindings again, please disregard keybind
    weirdness.
    
    Will prevent this from showing up on Curse for now.

    o WiP:  use_item support, not ready for primetime.
    + For modifiers, if the value doesn't resolve to an actual value, the
    value will be stored as a string.  So name=blah will first try to assign
    the value of blah to args.name, but if that is nil, it will store the
    strong "blah" in args.name.  Because.

    Update Elemental APLs...
    
    + Used the tweaked importer to try SimC's Elemental APLs instead of my
    handwritten versions from SEL.  Will see how that goes.
    + Aura Info can actually be shown on displays now.  Added Buff/Debuff
    Remaining Time as an option.
    
    o Tweaked the aura counting code to leave auras alone since debuffs
    won't actually "tick" to keep themselves off the clock.  May be adverse
    impacts...
    + Added customization options for Show Aura Info consistent with the
    other Extras.
    + Quick and dirty fix for Snapshots doing duplicate string replacements
    (i.e., 'buff.X.duration' and 'duration' in the same script).
    + Buffs/debuffs will grab info from the class aura table if it exists,
    so that we anticipate 'duration' information for auras we know about.

    Added Class Settings: Exclusions
    
    + Added checklist of abilities one can use to exclude abilities from
    your displays.  This is done on a per-profile basis for now, but could
    conceivably be done per-display if needed.
    
    + Added 'active_mongoose_fury' which compares buff.mongoose_fury.remains
    > latency * 2 -- this hopefully makes the addon slightly less likely to
    recommend another Mongoose Bite when Mongoose Fury is falling off faster
    than you can realistically react.  APL will be updated to use this.

    o Delay keybind overrides until out of combat, if needed.
    o Fix typo 'csating' -> 'casting'.
    + Added DH traits and legendary effects (very few, really).
    + Change 'variable' or "Store Value" actions to just grab the result
    from the action list, instead of snapshotting it.
    o Do a better job of grabbing keybinds for abilities that shift between
    forms.
    + Create some really, really ugly string manipulation code to simplify
    importing the DH Havoc APL directly from SimulationCraft.
    + target.distance will now return the average of the minimum and maximum
    range estimates.
    + target.exists is now a valid check.
    + target.in_range is now a valid check, will check on a per-ability
    basis or default to true.
    + cooldown.X.adjusted_remains added, simply returns the 'remains' value.

    + Iterated on Demon Hunter support.
    + Debug setting is no longer needed.  When you pause, debug info is

    + Put Custom Toggles back in.
    
    ? Still trying to figure out when to rescrape keybindings to
    most-efficiently catch when abilities change due to a form change.
    
    + SEL and SimC Elemental APLs will default to the Ascendance APL when
    you aren't 110 yet (so that you at least get *something*).
    
    + Intentionally broke the module code (for now) so that the forked
    modules stop working.

    Instead of recaching auras on every UNIT_AURA for player/target, notify

    Please don't look.
    
    1.  Fixed a bug with judgment_override for Retribution Paladins.  Thanks
    @Notcalx for the report.
    
    2.  Please ignore the Demon Hunter stuff.  It's not anywhere near ready.
    
    3.  Added 'variable' (a.k.a. Store Value) support like SimC.  Specify a
    value name "taco" and the conditions are stored in it.  Other actions
    can use value.taco to retrieve that.  SimC does stuff with this.  Just
    embrace it.
    
    4.  Action Lists can no longer be disabled because wtf is the point of
    disabling an action list?
    
    5.  Added 'deficit_pct' and 'deficit_percent' to resource values.
    
    6.  Uggh.

    Tweaks, Updates, Fixes
    
    + The addon will now try to learn about buffs that aren't manually
    entered into the addon.
    + The addon will now cache aura information instead of grabbing it fresh
    from the API every update cycle.
    + The addon will now throttle itself to 1 update/second outside of
    combat, unless something relevant happens (target change, buffs/debuffs
    drop/refresh, you cast something...).
    
    Shaman:
    + Added duration info to several auras.
    + Corrected Stormbringer ID.
    + Removed the special logic for Spiritual Journey, since the game
    handles it well-enough without workarounds.
    + Added Lightning Rod as a target-cycling aura when it is talented (this
    means that using cycle_targets for Lightning Bolt/Chain Lightning should
    work at least a little better until I suppose the target_if syntax).
    + Imported the newer SimC APLs for Elemental and made adjustments
    accordingly.

    Manually include LibArtifactData-1.0 (as LibArtifactData-1.0h) because Curse won't package the new one.

    Fixes, Tweaks, Refinements
    
    + Added a system to force one-time changes to
    displays/profiles/action-lists.  This enables me to fix settings without
    pushing people to reset their whole profiles.  Example usage here will
    be that I'm going to turn off 'Debug' mode because it uses a lot of CPU
    for folks who aren't actually debugging.
    o Added Spell ID for Lashing Flames because duhhh.
    
    + Added simplified Mode Visibility to displays.  This basically makes it
    easier to quickly decide whether a display is a "Primary" or "AOE"
    display (like how I make them) with regard to both target detection and
    visibility.  This includes a fix that makes it so the two-display,
    ST/AOE mode only happens under the right circumstances.  Your experience
    with the addon may change.
    + Refinements made to which events are tracked and which force updates.
    + Minor tweaks to default Paladin/Shaman displays.

    Update helper system.
    
    + When I screw things up, I can set up one-time profile patches now.
    The addon will now make a good faith effort to fix up your APL hooks
    under the new system.  Once.
    + Forcing Debug mode off one time only.  Shouldn't have it on by
    default.
    + Really, really don't do unnecessary data crunching with Debug mode
    off.
    + More tweaks to forced addon updates based on events.

    7.2:  Force update on CLEU: SPELL_CAST_START/SUCCESS rather than UNIT_SPELLCAST_START/SUCCEEDED.

    7.2:  So much stuff.
    
    This update note is objectively bad.

    ALPHA:  Try event-driven (with 0.05 ICD) updates instead of interval updates.
    
    + Add resource.time_to_XX calculation.

    Fixes for run_action_list, call_action_list, ...
    
    o When an action list's criteria is checked, it will not use padded
    criteria (i.e., recheck in 0.1s, half-GCD, etc.) because this has caused
    the addon to test inferior action lists before their criteria are met
    (blocking higher priority lists).
    o Added 0.05s of padding to regenerated resource prediction time.  Wew
    lads!
