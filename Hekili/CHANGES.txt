    Assorted Fixes
    
    o Fixed assignment of textures for abilities that change during
    Metamorphosis.
    o Use NoTaint_UIDropDownMenu to avoid taint issues.
    o Skin the dropdown menu if ElvUI is installed.

    Added Class Settings: Exclusions
    
    + Added checklist of abilities one can use to exclude abilities from
    your displays.  This is done on a per-profile basis for now, but could
    conceivably be done per-display if needed.
    
    + Added 'active_mongoose_fury' which compares buff.mongoose_fury.remains
    > latency * 2 -- this hopefully makes the addon slightly less likely to
    recommend another Mongoose Bite when Mongoose Fury is falling off faster
    than you can realistically react.  APL will be updated to use this.

    Tweaks, work on DH, etc.
    
    o Delay keybind overrides until out of combat, if needed.
    o Fix typo 'csating' -> 'casting'.
    + Added DH traits and legendary effects (very few, really).
    + Change 'variable' or "Store Value" actions to just grab the result
    from the action list, instead of snapshotting it.
    o Do a better job of grabbing keybinds for abilities that shift between
    forms.
    + Create some really, really ugly string manipulation code to simplify
    importing the DH Havoc APL directly from SimulationCraft.
    + target.distance will now return the average of the minimum and maximum
    range estimates.
    + target.exists is now a valid check.
    + target.in_range is now a valid check, will check on a per-ability
    basis or default to true.
    + cooldown.X.adjusted_remains added, simply returns the 'remains' value.

    + Artifact traits will now use the English-version SimC-like keys
    regardless of region.  (Ashes to Ashes -> ashes_to_ashes, even if your
    client is in Spanish or German or whatever.)
    
    o Fix for Rainfall duration extension, because that matters.
    
    o Iterate on minimap icon.
    
    o Don't force update on UNIT_SPELLCAST_START or
    UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED.  Wait for SPELL_CAST_START and
    SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS in the combat log.

    Minimap Icon, integrate Monk and Hunter support
    
    + Added LibDataBroker and LibDBIcon to support a minimap icon, some
    quick setting adjustment w/o keybindings.
    + Brought the Monk and Hunter modules into the addon.
    + Iterated on Demon Hunter support.
    + Debug setting is no longer needed.  When you pause, debug info is
    collected for one cycle and then shut off again.
    + Put Custom Toggles back in.
    
    ? Still trying to figure out when to rescrape keybindings to
    most-efficiently catch when abilities change due to a form change.
    
    + SEL and SimC Elemental APLs will default to the Ascendance APL when
    you aren't 110 yet (so that you at least get *something*).
    
    + Intentionally broke the module code (for now) so that the forked
    modules stop working.

    Reduce aura caching workload.
    
    Instead of recaching auras on every UNIT_AURA for player/target, notify
    the addon to update auras on the next reset if UNIT_AURA fired for
    player or target.  Much less CPU, such performance.  WoW.

    Re-fix judgment_override to work at 4+ HoPo (the previous issue was
    related to aura-detection rather than HoPo check).
    
    Trying new on-demand debug system that only snapshots info when you push
    the button.
    
    Fix broken update frequency logic that slowed the addon down in boss
    fights.

    Please don't look.
    
    1.  Fixed a bug with judgment_override for Retribution Paladins.  Thanks
    @Notcalx for the report.
    
    2.  Please ignore the Demon Hunter stuff.  It's not anywhere near ready.
    
    3.  Added 'variable' (a.k.a. Store Value) support like SimC.  Specify a
    value name "taco" and the conditions are stored in it.  Other actions
    can use value.taco to retrieve that.  SimC does stuff with this.  Just
    embrace it.
    
    4.  Action Lists can no longer be disabled because wtf is the point of
    disabling an action list?
    
    5.  Added 'deficit_pct' and 'deficit_percent' to resource values.
    
    6.  Uggh.

    Tweaks, Updates, Fixes
    
    + The addon will now try to learn about buffs that aren't manually
    entered into the addon.
    + The addon will now cache aura information instead of grabbing it fresh
    from the API every update cycle.
    + The addon will now throttle itself to 1 update/second outside of
    combat, unless something relevant happens (target change, buffs/debuffs
    drop/refresh, you cast something...).
    
    Shaman:
    + Added duration info to several auras.
    + Corrected Stormbringer ID.
    + Removed the special logic for Spiritual Journey, since the game
    handles it well-enough without workarounds.
    + Added Lightning Rod as a target-cycling aura when it is talented (this
    means that using cycle_targets for Lightning Bolt/Chain Lightning should
    work at least a little better until I suppose the target_if syntax).
    + Imported the newer SimC APLs for Elemental and made adjustments
    accordingly.

    Fixes, Tweaks, Refinements
    
    + Added a system to force one-time changes to
    displays/profiles/action-lists.  This enables me to fix settings without
    pushing people to reset their whole profiles.  Example usage here will
    be that I'm going to turn off 'Debug' mode because it uses a lot of CPU
    for folks who aren't actually debugging.
    o Added Spell ID for Lashing Flames because duhhh.
    
    + Added simplified Mode Visibility to displays.  This basically makes it
    easier to quickly decide whether a display is a "Primary" or "AOE"
    display (like how I make them) with regard to both target detection and
    visibility.  This includes a fix that makes it so the two-display,
    ST/AOE mode only happens under the right circumstances.  Your experience
    with the addon may change.
    + Refinements made to which events are tracked and which force updates.
    + Minor tweaks to default Paladin/Shaman displays.

    Update helper system.
    
    + When I screw things up, I can set up one-time profile patches now.
    The addon will now make a good faith effort to fix up your APL hooks
    under the new system.  Once.
    + Forcing Debug mode off one time only.  Shouldn't have it on by
    default.
    + Really, really don't do unnecessary data crunching with Debug mode
    off.
    + More tweaks to forced addon updates based on events.

    Fixes for run_action_list, call_action_list, ...
    
    o When an action list's criteria is checked, it will not use padded
    criteria (i.e., recheck in 0.1s, half-GCD, etc.) because this has caused
    the addon to test inferior action lists before their criteria are met
    (blocking higher priority lists).
    o Added 0.05s of padding to regenerated resource prediction time.  Wew
    lads!

    Improved Debugging, Incremental Fixes
    
    + The debug system will now allow you to generate a text-log of its
    decision-making process for clearer debugging.  There will be some
    iterating on this.
    + The 'Pause' key will generate a snapshot that can be viewed through
    /hekili.  The 'Pause' key can be set to *just* take a snapshot instead
    of freezing the display.
    + Energy/Focus abilities default to a CPU-intensive decision-making
    process to help offset issues with resource regeneration.  This can be
    disabled by checking "Low Impact Mode" under general settings.
    
    + Added 'Fatigued' to the list of Bloodlust-blocking auras.

    FIXES
    
    o Reset the delay after advance to the cast time of a selected action
    (failing to do so could cause distortions in the predicted game state,
    i.e. if the addon had a delay of 0.5s to refresh a buff that was falling
    off in 0.75s, when the addon advanced 0.5s then tried to update, it
    would result in checking buff duration at 0.5s + 0.5s and the buff would
    already be down).  Discussing time offsets is a pain in the ass and I
    understand why Murozond would want to destroy the timeline.
    o Time Script and Conditions debugging will have more accurate and
    useful information.
    o Added 'time_to_max_charges' attribute to cooldowns.
    o Removed an error() call that just annoyed me; it should've known
    better than to mess with me.
    o Removed more tick-based regen stuff, just using time seems to work
    better.

    Display Updates, Forced Updates, Remove Rounding
    
    o Display Updates will happen more frequently (even if the
    recommendations haven't been refreshed).  This helps text timers work
    properly.
    o Talent-swapping and cooldown toggling will force immediate
    recommendation updates.
    o Remove a lot of rounding that wasn't needed after the refresh bug was
    found.

    + Use range on Hand of Reckoning for Judgment since IsSpellInRange()
    returns bad data for Judgment.

    Shaman Fixes
    
    o More tweaking to Elemental APLs.
    o Default Elemental AOE display will assume a minimum of 2 targets,
    rather than 3.
    o Enhancement APL will use `true_active_enemies` value to determine
    whether to apply/refresh Crash Lightning buff (so that if you set to
    single-target mode for a fight like Mythic Botanist, it will still
    encourage you to activate Crash Lightning for the buff).

    artifact frame open...

    FIXES:  WW Monk, Focus/Energy
    
    o Arcane Torrent flagged as offGCD, will not interfere with WW Hit
    Combo.
    o Focus/Energy modeling will be ignored if your class module doesn't
    have focus/energy models.
    o Go away, new target system, you're not happening yet.

    UPDATES, FIXES
    
    Shaman:  Fix `maelstrom` in Elemental APLs to use `maelstrom.current`.
    o Fix cycle_targets indicators in some Elemental APLs.
    - Retire broken SimC import APLs.
    
    Scripts:
    o Time Scripts will round delays to the thousandth of a second.
    
    State:
    o Fix for resource meta-functions (they were not being used; I don't
    know that I use them anyway but now they'll work if I do).
    o Resource `time_to_max` expr will try to factor resource regeneration
    better (tick-based).
    o When advancing the clock, resources will be generated if the clock
    advances to the regeneration point (would previously only regenerate if
    the clock passes the regen tick).
    
    Targets:  Insert initial framework for tracking buffs/health of enemies
    live, this will be used to allow improved target-cycle recommendations.
    
    Utils:
    + roundUp function now uses math instead of string functions for
    efficiency's sake.

Author: Hekili <Hekili@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 7 16:10:48 2017 -0500

    Assorted Timing Fixes
    
    + Registered more interrupts as interrupts; this enables them to ignore
    the GCD.  (Other offGCD abilities will wait for the GCD to prevent
    queue-jumping.)
    + More resource regen tuning (uses worst case timing for abilities that
    are waiting for resources).

    disabling of set_bonuses.
    
    State:  Abilities can use a custom spend() function for cases where
    padding resources is needed.

    Power forecasting adjustments.
    
    + The addon now keeps track of an average tick rate for energy/focus.
    When predicting how long it will take for an ability to have enough
    resources, the addon will project to the next tick.

    More Fixes

    2.  Detect BGs/Arenas and turn off set-bonuses in those settings
    (equipped.X will fail except for Artifacts).
    3.  Track UNIT_POWER_FREQUENT ticks and round energy gains to the next
    tick.

    FIXES
    
    CORE
    + spendResources() comes *before* runHandler() so that the handler
    doesn't change the amount of resources to spend.  For instance,
    runHandler could remove Divine Purpose or The Fires of Justice, which
    would change the cost of Divine Storm or Templar's Verdict.
    + Tweak the flicker protection a little bit.
    
    STATE
    + Slight cleanup to timeToReady().

    Assorted Fixes, Improvements for Hunter Support
    
    Classes:  Block a 'pseudo-start' of combat for actions that are "in-air"
    and projected to land.
    + Add Netherwinds to the list of Bloodlust buffs.
    
    Core:  Initial implementation of "flicker protection."
    + Basically, if it sees that the addon's last several recommendations
    have flickered between the newest actions and something else, it just
    won't bother updating.  Will be iterating on this.
    
    Events:  Spells that have been cast and are projected to land will
    default to a 0.05 travel time.
    
    State:  'query_time' will now incorporate latency into its
    recommendation.  This will result in the addon making recommendations
    based on a slightly later game-state.
    + Holy Power is treated like a regenerating resource when Liadrin's Fury
    Unleashed is equipped and AW/Crusade is up.  THIS NEEDS TESTING.
    + Tried to improve ability "timeToReady" calculations for Survival
    Hunters when using Spitting Cobra.

Date:   Sun Jan 29 20:26:30 2017 -0500

    Harder, Faster, Better, Stronger
    
    Events:  The addon will respond more quickly to events that impact
    ability recommendations.  This may require further tuning on a per-spec
    basis, to make sure all abilities with a travel time are flagged
    appropriately.
    + The addon will now gather keybindings using the default API.  This
    *should* work for any bar mod, but I'm not going to test them
    personally.
    
    Paladins:  You can now specify the maximum amount of Holy Power that
    you'll allow Wake of Ashes to waste.  The addon will not recommend Wake
    of Ashes if you have more than the specified amount of Holy Power (and
    have the Ashes to Ashes trait).
    
    Core:  The addon will do a better job of purging ancient profiles so it
    will, you know, work.
    + Display updates will occur more frequently (so Monk/Hunter timers will
    be less...lurchy?).
    + The addon will attempt to detect and display ability keybindings.
    
    Options:  Default Nameplate Detection Range increased to 8.
    + Recommendation Window added, allows you to specify that an ability has
    to be available for at least X seconds (by default, 0.1) in order to be
    recommend.  This *may* reduce some ability flicker.
    + Each display has its own independent settings for keybinds (show/don't
    show, upper/lowercase).
    o Renamed the "Blizzard Overlay" to "Overlay Glow" for slight clarity
    improvement.
    
    State:  Keep track of latency, may factor it into buff.X.up,
    buff.X.remains and similar criteria going forward.
    - Removed the 0.05s padding from timeToReady() for focus/energy based
    classes.

    Tweaks and Fixes
    
    Classes:  Store item keys when storing gearsets.
    - Hunters gain 15 Focus from Arcane Torrent.
    
    Core and Scripts:  Removed old override and delay arguments from
    checkScript.
    + Added 'recheck' as arg4 to checkScript.  recheck tells the addon to
    see if the same script passes after `recheck' seconds, ostensibly to
    confirm that the action will be recommended for at least that much time.
    o recheck will need further config option support through the UI, it is
    not yet used.
    
    State: Check GetSpellCharges() using spellID rather than spell name,
    mainly to fix Storm, Earth, and Fire but will surely impact other
    things.
    o Built in padding on energy/focus regen reduced to 0.05s from 0.1s.

    Scripts:  Allow basic duplicate checking to see if action criteria is
    met over a window period (not presently used).
    
    State:  Improve basic pet mechanics.
    + Fix an error with regard to unit IDs in debuffs.
    + Remove maelstrom hook from the state table.

    Elemental Improvements
    
    + Flagged abilities that don't start combat as passive.
    + Iterated on Elemental APLs.  Combined the SimC and SEL and left the
    result in SEL lists.  Some spells were missing from the SEL lists.
    Should be an improvement.
    
    Core:  Prevent an error with setting delay text on Monk abilities that
    are not yet ready.
    
    Events:  Force an early refresh on UNIT_SPELLCAST_START to help caster
    modules (just Ele for now).

    Cleanups, fixes...
    
    Classes:  When initiating fake combat, start it just before a cast
    finishes because reasons.
    
    Shaman:  New Class Settings.
    + Aggressive Stormkeeper:  Used in handwritten Elemental playlists to
    recommend Stormkeeper closer to "on cooldown."
    + Predict Melee:  Used by the addon engine to decide whether to try to
    predict Maelstrom generated by your weapon swings.
    + Predict Fury of Air:  Used by the addon engine to decide whether to
    try to predict Maelstrom lost by Fury of Air.
    o Fix for Lava Burst generating 12 Maelstrom.
    o Moved MP swing generation and FoA expenditure prediction into
    Shaman.lua and added options to turn it on/off.
    + Wrote new APLs based off the guides at Storm, Earth, and Lava for
    Elemental Shamans.
    + Added some class settings for Elemental and Enhancement.
    o Corrected some MP generation stuff for Elementals.
    + Fix Totem Mastery to apply the invented 'totem_mastery' buff.
    + New default APLs, Enhancement APLs support more class settings.
    
    Core:  Set spell textures by spell ID rather than by spell name due to
    localization.
    
    Options:  Add a bunch of options regarding target detection, fix some
    other stuff.
    
    Targets:  Make target detection work with new addon settings.

    7.1.5...
    
    OK, lots and lots of stuff.  Basically, this is the big update that
    hopefully makes 7.1.5 work for Enhancement, Elemental (suuuper beta),
    Windwalker, Brewmaster, Retribution, and Protection.
    
    Shaman:
    + Improved Totem Mastery detection, has its own buff now, can check the
    remaining time more effectively.
    + Moved fake buffs to ID -100 and lower.
    + Aftershock refunds 0.3 MP.
    - Removed "Prioritize Buffs" setting as its no longer relevant to the
    Enhancement APL.
    + Added "Fury of Air: Maelstrom Padding" setting so that you can keep
    yourself from overspending Maelstrom when you're keeping Fury of Air up.
    o Left the "Maelstrom: Boulderfist" setting but it's not actually used
    for the moment.
    - Removed/hid the "Maelstrom: Crash Lightning" setting since it's not
    relevant to the current APL.
    + Fixed Ascendance ID for Elemental.
    + Made Boulderfist benefit from Gathering of the Maelstrom.
    + Updated Earth Elemental CD and duration.
    + Earth Shock, Earthquake, Elemental Blast, Flame Shock, Frost Shock,
    Icefury, Lava Beam, etc. will spend a stack of Elemental Focus.
    + Frost Shock will spend a stack of Icefury.
    + Icefury will generate 24 MP.
    + Fury of Air will cost 3 MP.
    + Gave Lightning Bolt a VERY HIGH travel time to see if that stabilizes
    some MP forecasting.
    + LB + Power of the Maelstrom generates 14 MP.  Hopefully.  I'm hoping
    it's guaranteeing an Overload and not just giving 2x MP if you're lucky
    enough to Overload.  Needs testing.
    + Overcharge LB cooldown is 12 * haste.
    + Rockbiter gives 20 MP + Gathering of the Maelstrom bonus.
    + Rockbiter will actually apply Landslide now.
    + Storm Elemental CD/duration halved.
    + Totem Mastery is no longer usable if 15 seconds remain on its buffs
    (i.e., you're in-range of the totems and duration is still > 15s).
    + New default APLs.  Pray for Omarion.
    
    Paladins:
    o Changed Blade of Wrath's talent ID???
    o Judgment's duration is 8 seconds.  Feign function disabled in favor of
    new travel-time prediction.
    o Liadrin's Fury Unleashed gives 1 HP every 4 sec (was 2.5 sec).
    + Try to model haste gains from Crusade when spending HP.
    o NEED TO MODEL HASTE LOSS FROM CRUSADE DROPPING IN STATE.ADVANCE().
    o Divine Intervention reduces Divine Shield CD by 20%.
    o Execution Sentence costs 0 HP with Divine Purpose, otherwise TFoJ
    reduces by 1.
    o Execution Sentence removes DP first, then TFoJ.  Not both.
    - Greater Blessing of Might is gone.
    o Judgment has a travel time of 30 yd/sec.
    o Word of Glory spending accounts for Divine Purpose, TFoJ.
    o Modified WoG's heal.
    o New defaults displays/APLs.
    
    Classes:
    + Support new prev.#.ability syntax for new APLs.
    + Improve weapon swing projections at start of combat (improves
    Maelstrom projections).
    + Add 'casting' as a debuff since some APLs check for
    target.debuff.casting.up.
    + Added 'run_action_list' which jumps to another action list and does
    not return to the caller.
    + Trimmed potion listing, made potion.usable() check if you have any
    potions to use.
    + Started with retireDefaults( .. ) which will eventually wipe old
    defaults instead of leaving them in your profile.
    
    Core:
    o Indentation cleanup.
    o TODO:  ADD CHAIN LIGHTNING/LAVA BEAM TO ICON CACHE.
    o Cleanups for time/ready scripts, modifications to make cycle_targets
    work a bit better (and more automatically).
    o Delay text added for Monks since they may be waiting to use something
    that's usable based on energy regeneration.
    
    Events:
    + Track casts on/off/regardless-of GCD status.
    + Watch Fury of Air ticks for Maelstrom projection purposes.
    
    Options:
    + Made some "modifiers" more user-friendly, but the interface is shit.
    Will update again soon.
    + Improved the importer a lot, but still a long ways to go.

    BETA:  Fixes to latest beta, Paladin, Shaman.
    
    PALADIN
    o Fix toggle for Artifact Ability (under 'toggle' rather than
    'settings').
    
    SHAMAN
    o Fix Aftershock refunds to not cause an error.
    
    STATE
    o Trying modification to target counts; if the addon has detected more
    enemies than nameplates have shown, trust the addon's detection.  We'll
    see how this goes.  (Should fix issues when Blizzard bugs out on hitbox
    sizes, i.e. EN Dragons).
    o Instead of advancing to the end of the GCD, trying cooldown.X.remains
    returning X's remaining CD or the remaining GCD, whichever is greater.
    Should apply only to offGCD abilities.  Makes the addon more friendly to
    weaving offGCD stuff like interrupts.
    
    UI
    o Fix an outstanding bug with the notification panel creating a dead
    spot for mouse interaction.

    Elemental Shaman Support, Legendaries, Bugfixes, Engine Improvements...
    
    CLASSES:  Add support for Xavaric's Magnum Opus shield buff.
    
    SHAMAN:  Add initial Elemental Shaman support.  May be missing some
    artifact and legendary mechanics.
    
    + Elemental Shaman:  *WARNING*  SimulationCraft importing does not work
    for the default APL at this time.  This will have to wait for an
    importer overhaul, since the current importer does not support
    'target_if'.
    + Elemental Shamans: nameplate targets will not be used because you
    cannot reliably detect the number of targets clustered at range.  This
    means targets won't be counted until you hit them.
    + Eye of the Twisting Nether: Added to many damaging abilities.  Can
    count your Twisting Nether buffs with twisting_nether.count (i.e., if
    you want to wait to pop a cooldown until you have all your buffs up).
    + Legendaries:  Implement mechanics from class/spec legendaries.  Not
    sure if Spiritual Journey will work right, yet.
    
    CORE:
    o Abilities that are channeled will run their handlers at the start of
    their cast rather than the end.
    + Added a delay counter on the upper left of primary icons.  This counts
    down to let you know that an ability may be ready, but the addon
    recommends waiting to use it.  This is useful for stuff like 'use Tiger
    Palm at 65 Energy' but you actually have only 40.  May need to make this
    'optional' or at least prettier.
    
    EVENTS:
    + Add preliminary support for tracking what spells are 'in the air',
    i.e., were cast but have not yet landed.  This will be used to improve
    recommendations following abilities that have a travel time and effects
    that fire when the spell hits (rather than when the spell was cast).
    
    ARTIFACT DATA:
    o Attempt to prevent the artifact API bug, yet again.
    
    OPTIONS:
    o Use [[ ]] for storing display/list default names so that `/hekili
    makedefaults' doesn't freak out with names that have apostrophes.
    o Add a new importer warning for APLs that can't be properly read.
    
    SCRIPTS
    o storeValues() will always clear the table before exiting if there are
    no new elements to store.
    
    STATE
    o spendCharges() will set a cooldown to 0 if you're left with at least 1
    charge.
    o The calculated haste / spell_haste / melee_haste values will now use
    values from the state.stat table, which allows ability handlers that
    update haste values to impact project cast times/GCD times/etc.
    + Added 'refreshable' option that returns true if a debuff with the same
    name as the tested ability has less than 30% of the debuff's duration.
    This could use more finesse.
    + reset():  Wipe modified stat values and get fresh values during future
    queries.
    - reset():  Use global_cooldown wherever class.gcd was previously used.
    o reset():  Don't advance to the end of the GCD any longer; may help
    with recommendations for stuff that was off-GCD.
    + advance():  Advance times will be rounded to the ceiling of the
    hundredth second (0.01).  1.505 becomes 1.51 as does 1.501.  This helps
    improve consistency of recommendations (reducing flicker) and also
    addresses an issue where abilities that would be recommended based on a
    calculated future time (i.e., reaching a cap or energy level) wouldn't
    actually pass the threshold by some infinitesimal margin so we were
    spending a charge before we gained it.
    + advance():  Add hook to allow class/spec modules to do extra stuff
    after advance() completes its work.  The first usage of this is to try
    to support Spiritual Journey's Feral Spirit cooldown reduction.
    + isReady():  Check timeToReady() for all actions that are being tested
    using Time Scripts.
    
    UI
    + When showing the values used in a diagnostic tooltip (Debug enabled
    and Paused), show each element in alphabetical order for easier reading
    ).
    + Add font strings for delays, keybindings (still not supported yet).
    Delay and KB is at 67% of prmary font size; should probably make these
    into options at a later date.
    
    UTILS
    o Moved orderedPairs here so I can use it the editor and tooltips or
    wherever else I might want.

    Fix for Default Imports
    
    *BUGFIX*
    
    The default display export strings were incorrectly storing which action
    lists were attached to them.  This worked okay for most people who don't
    have custom or old action lists, but not for others.  This should fix
    the bug and default settings should properly be recovered at
    login/reload.

    New Specialization Support (Protection Paladin) and New Script Type!
    
    Initial support for Protection Paladins.  It's possible and even likely
    that some buff IDs are incorrect and some mechanics are not yet modeled
    correctly.  We'll see!
    
    *Protection Paladins*
    Protection stuff includes new Class Settings for toggling defensives
    on/off ('use_defensives' in scripts), set a health threshold for
    Hand/Light of the Protector self-heals (if met, 'use_self_heals' is
    true), set a damage threshold for how much incoming damage you must be
    receiving before Shield of the Righteous is recommended defensively (the
    default action list still avoids capping SotR charges).
    
    *New Script Type: Time*
    While the default SimC like scripts are sufficient in the vast majority
    of cases, sometimes it is more important to calculate *when* an action
    list entry should be ready rather than if it is ready now (or when the
    ability's cooldown/resources are available).
    
    Example:  You have 8 seconds remaining before Shield of the Righteous
    will reach 3 charges.  You want Shield of the Righteous to be used when
    you are capped on charges, so you aren't wasting charge time gained from
    Judgment.
    
    SimC-like Conditions:
    
    cooldown.shield_of_the_righteous.charges=cooldown.shield_of_the_righteous.charges_max
    
    This will be false UNTIL you've reached 3 charges.
    
    Time Script:
    
    (cooldown.shield_of_the_righteous.charges_max-cooldown.shield_of_the_righteous.charges_fractional)*action.shield_of_the_righteous.recharge
    
    This will find out how much remaining charge is required and multiply by
    recharge time (which should equal 8 seconds, based on the case we
    provided).
    
    Using the Time Script will tell the addon to anticipate that Shield of
    the Righteous *will be* ready in 8 seconds, instead of the default
    behavior of saying "no, it's not ready yet" and then checking again
    after something else has been recommended.
    
    Time Scripts have access to additional values to help with
    decision-making:  'delay' is the time until the ability is off-cooldown
    or until you will have resources (based on resource regeneration) --
    whichever is greater.  'spend' is the amount of resources required to
    use the ability.  'spend_type' is the type of resources spent by the
    ability.
    
    Time Scripts are heavily restricted -- you can't write full functions
    and you cannot access the global environment.  You can provide an
    equation that gives a numeric value, and use simple conditions like:
    
    holy_power.current>1 and 2 or 0
    
    ...which would equal 2 if you have more than one Holy Power, or 0 if you
    have 1 or fewer Holy Power.
    
    *Double Checking*
    If no ability's criteria is successful in your action lists, the addon
    will now advance by 1s and try again.  It will do this twice before
    giving up on providing you with a recommendation.
    
    *BUGFIXES*
    - Recommending an offGCD ability will no longer trick the addon engine
    into thinking that the GCD was reset.

    Additional support for Paladin abilities.
    
    Corrected 'repentence' to 'repentance'.
    Added many previously unsupported or unlisted abilities available to
    Retribution Paladins.
    Added hook in state.spend() to support Crusade gaining stacks from
    expending holy power.
    Added 'target.is_undead' and 'target.is_demon' -- used internally to
    apply Wake of Ashes stun.
    Added support for healing spells actually healing (so that if you
    recommend Flash of Light based on current health, your predicted health
    value changes and something else would get recommended next).
    
    Cleaned up some descriptions in the /hekili options UI.  Auto/Manual
    given more descriptive names.
    
    Fix stat.spell_power to actually give a useful value.

    Told GitHub to ignore some libraries that the Curse packager will
    manage.
