    Bugfixes, Legendary Support, Class Settings Updates
    
    + Legendaries.
    + Hidden Master's Forbidden Touch aura.
    + Support Drinking Horn Cover mechanic via hook to spend().
    + Track staggered damage over past 10 seconds, use this for
    recommendations re: Purifying Brew.
    + Settings added to specify when to use Purifying Brew at varying levels
    of Stagger.
    o Fix for checking Artifact Ability toggle.
    + Breath of Fire: Support Firestone Walkers, reduce CD on Fortifying
    Brew.
    + Fists of Fury: Support Katsuo's Eclipse for chi cost reduction.
    o Fix for Fists of Fury; it was extending the GCD by its cast time,
    which was redundant.
    + Purifying Brew actually uses the purify threshold settings internally.
    May revisit this choice.
    + Purifying Brew: Support Gai Plin's self-heal effect.
    o Fix for Rising Sun Kick: Apply cooldown and cost reductions from
    Serenity.
    o Fix for Rushing Jade Wind: No resource cost for Brewmaster.
    + Touch of Death: Attempt to support Hidden Master's Forbidden Touch,
    cannot test yet.
    + Update default APLs.
