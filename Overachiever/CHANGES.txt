- Correct a problem with holiday/event toasts that was introduced with WoW patch 7.2.5.
- To reduce loading times, the process that examines achievement criteria has been removed from startup. It now does its work incrementally, in the background, until its task is complete.
- The Holiday/Event Toasts options "Do not automatically hide" and "Require click to hide" now default to disabled. (This only affects new installations of the addon. Current users' options are preserved.)
- The exploration achievement associated with Thunder Totem is now that of its parent zone, Highmountain.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for the Blight Boar concert at the Darkmoon Faire, Black Temple timewalking, and The Deaths of Chromie scenario.
-- The zone Thunder Totem now shows suggestions from its parent zone, Highmountain.
