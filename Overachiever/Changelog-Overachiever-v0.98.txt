- Fix "Pandarian Angler" reminder tooltips being shown based on the wrong option.
- "Draenor Angler" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip for fishing nodes that you need to fish from. The Recent Reminders that result will actually be for its criteria achievements, since it is a meta-achievement.
- Now shows "Already fished" tooltip even if the entire achievement is complete (if the option is enabled) unless the achievement only required a certain number of fish from a list to be fished ("Limnologist", "Oceanographer").
- Fix error when attempting to detect if fishing pole is equipped.

- Fixed issue where the position of the draggable Achievement UI was not used despite the "Remember position" option being enabled. The option once again divorces the Achievement UI from the positioning system used by Character Info, the Spellbook, etc.
- Attempt to fix addon compatibility issue resulting in an error message the first time the achievement frame is opened if Overachiever's draggable Achievement UI option is enabled.
- Suggestions Tab: Added additional suggestions for Draenor zones/dungeons/raids and Cataclysm raids. (Thanks to chrisnolanca for many of these.)
- Fix detection of fishing poles for non-English locales.
- Tabs module: Fix problem where an achievement that was given a blue background due to being a future step of a series continued to use that background after it became the current step (because an achievement was completed that session).

- New option: Add tooltip in achievement UI giving your character's progress on quantity-based achievements which were earned on your account but not with the current character.
- Tabs module: The new Related tab has been implemented, allowing you to better see a specified base achievement's related achievements. Ctrl+shift+click on an achievement in the UI or on an achievement link to specify the achievement and open the tab. ("Related" achievements are those that are in the same series as the base, are one of the criteria of the base or of another in its series, or have as one of their own criteria either the base or an achievement in its series).
- Suggestions Tab:
-- New option: Display graphical notices next to the achievement frame indicating today's holiday events. Click a notice to get related suggestions.
-- Added suggestions for these holidays/events: Brewfest, Darkmoon Faire, Hallow's End, Day of the Dead, Pilgrim's Bounty, Feast of Winter Veil (alias Winter Veil). Ties in to the notice feature mentioned above or you can see them manually by entering the holiday name into the Suggestions tab.
- Watch Tab: Fixed an issue where, when naming a new list, hitting Enter ignored whether the name was valid.
- Slash command /oa now opens to the main options panel. However, the sub-panels list is expanded so you can easily get to Reminder Tooltips options.
- Fixed some visual elements of the options panel and Tabs module (missing background colors, etc.).
