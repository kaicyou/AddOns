--------------------

Infus:
	- Fix BigWigs trigger
	Ticket-Nr: 603
	- Fix Ignore Rune CD
	Similar idea to previously. If the cooldown's duration matches
	the duration of the spell then ignore it.
	
	Instead of harcoding 10s as the rune cd, use the duration that
	actualy runes have.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 599
	- Fix Rune Trigger do watch all runes if that is needed
	- Fix lua error triggercount being nil after editing auras
	- Fix Importing hiding explicitly shown auras
	Transmissons.lua wants to make sure that the WeakAurasOptions addon
	is loaded. OpenOptions has the side effect of potentially hiding
	the window though, which we don't want.
	
	So introduce a function LoadOptions which only loads the plugin.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 598
Benjamin Staneck:
	- fix a typo
InfusOnWoW:
	- GetSpellCount support + Primary Power Type check (#70)
	* Add GetSpellCount support for e.g. Expel Harm
	
	Ticket-Nr: 586
	
	* Add "Only if primary" checkbox to Power trigger
	
	Can be used to check that the primary power type is the selected
	power type.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 592
