--------------------

Infus:
	- Treat GCD correctly
	So the basic logic is:
	
	If we have a duration > 0 and it's different from the gcd, we have
	a genuine cooldown.
	
	If we either have a duration of 0, or equal to the gcd, the ability
	could have reset its cooldown.
	
	If the old cooldown was already less than the gcd, we don't want
	to reset it to 0 though.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 613
	- Fix region.state.trigger for additional triggers
	Which caused a bug where additional triggers showed no tooltip.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 615
	- Fix that using templates would break Duplicate for that aura
	The DisplayButtons save a reference to the table for the aura,
	so for existing auras we need to modify it directly.
	
	We don't need to a DeepCopy of this table anyway.
	- Entering Obliteration in any spell input would uppercase it
	Reported on Ticket 584
	- Fix Texture functions no longer working
	Regression introduced in the trigger state patch.
